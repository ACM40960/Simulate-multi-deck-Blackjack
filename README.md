This project simulates and analyzes the game of Blackjack (21) using **Monte Carlo methods**.  
It evaluates different strategies by simulating large numbers of games, computing expected values (EV), win/draw/loss rates, and visualizing performance.

## Features
- **Blackjack rules** (configurable decks, soft 17 behavior, splits, doubles, blackjack payout).
- **Strategy evaluation** from a pre-computed optimal strategy (`strategy.pkl`).
- **Monte Carlo simulation** for realistic statistical results.
- **Session-based performance analysis** with quantile bands.
- **CSV output** of simulated games for further analysis.
- **Visualization** of:
  - Strategy decision matrices (hard hands, soft hands, splits).
  - Cumulative earnings with percentile bands.
- **Summary statistics**: win rate, draw rate, loss rate, EV per hand.

## Background

### Blackjack Rules
- Number cards (2â€“10) have face value.  
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10.  
- Ace (A) is worth 1 or 11.  
- Dealer must hit until 17+ (soft 17 rules configurable).  
- Blackjack pays 3:2 (1.5 units).  

### Monte Carlo Method
This simulation relies on **repeated random sampling** to approximate probabilities and outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Game Modelling**
   - **Deck Model:** Supports single or multiple decks with shuffling.  
   - **Ace Handling:** Aces initially count as 11, adjusted to 1 if necessary to prevent busting.  
   - **Dealer Rules:** Dealer hits until reaching at least 17 (soft 17 behavior configurable).  

2. **Strategies Tested**
   - **Simple Strategy:** Always hit if hand value < 17, otherwise stand.  
   - **Basic Strategy (generated):** Decision table derived from simulated outcomes (`strategy.pkl`), includes hit/stand/double/split logic.  

3. **Simulation Process**
   - Deal two cards to player and dealer.  
   - Apply chosen strategy to player until they stand, bust, or take a double/split action.  
   - Dealer plays according to rules.  
   - Compare outcomes to determine win/draw/loss and calculate payoff.  
   - Repeat for thousands or millions of games to achieve stable statistics.  

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - **Win Rate** â€“ Percentage of units won.  
   - **Draw Rate** â€“ Percentage of units pushed.  
   - **Loss Rate** â€“ Percentage of units lost.  
   - **Average EV per Hand** â€“ Expected value in units over all hands.  
   - **Cumulative Earnings Graph** â€“ Visualizes performance over time with percentile bands.
